# ##  Set
# Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

# Set is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Tuple, and Dictionary,
#  all with different qualities and usage.

# A set is a collection which is both unordered and unindexed.

# Sets are written with curly brackets.

# Example
# Create a Set:

thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
print(thisset)



#Set
games_set = {"soccer","basketball","aakchel","regbi","chess","football","chess","chess"} # only 1 "chess" passes
# games_set.append(1,"sa")  no append
print(games_set)
